# Autonomous-Lane-changing-vechicle-prediction-model
This project predicts lane-changing intentions of surrounding vehicles to improve intelligent driving systems. Using machine learning and driver behavior analysis, the model identifies whether a driver intends to change lanes (1) or stay (0), enhancing autonomous driving safety.
